== What is Gatling?

It is a performance load-testing tool that easily allows us to simulate traffic, and perform load testing as code, so we can integrate it with CI/CD and automation.

We can make use of the https://gatling.io/docs/gatling/tutorials/quickstart/#using-the-recorder[Recorder] to record a scenario or write our own using the Java/Scala DSL.
